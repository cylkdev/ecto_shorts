# Comments overuse

## Definitions

Use `.agent/DEFINITIONS.md` as the source of truth for definitions used in this repository's standalone documentation system. If a reusable term is missing, add it there instead of defining it locally in this document.

## Problem

When you overuse comments or comment self-explanatory code, it can have the effect of making code less readable.

### Example

```elixir
# Returns the Unix timestamp of 5 minutes from the current time
defp unix_five_min_from_now do
  # Get the current time
  now = DateTime.utc_now()

  # Convert it to a Unix timestamp
  unix_now = DateTime.to_unix(now, :second)

  # Add five minutes in seconds
  unix_now + (60 * 5)
end
```

### Solution

Prefer clear and self-explanatory function names, module names, and variable names when possible. In the example above, the function name explains well what the function does, so you likely won't need the comment before it. The code also explains the operations well through variable names and clear function calls.

You could refactor the code above like this:

```elixir
@five_min_in_seconds 60 * 5

defp unix_five_min_from_now do
  now = DateTime.utc_now()
  unix_now = DateTime.to_unix(now, :second)
  unix_now + @five_min_in_seconds
end
```

We removed the unnecessary comments. We also added a `@five_min_in_seconds` module attribute, which serves the additional purpose of giving a name to the "magic" number `60 * 5`, making the code clearer and more expressive.
